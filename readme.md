# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to the repository for various data science and machine learning projects. This repository contains a collection of projects related to anomaly detection, regression analysis, decision trees, natural language processing, and more. Each project is organized into its respective folder.

Each subfolder contains specific projects related to different areas of data science and machine learning. Below is a brief overview of the content in each subfolder:

### Anomaly detection in Time Series
Projects related to detecting anomalies in time series data.

### Apple and Google Play Store Analysis
Analysis of data from Apple and Google Play stores, including data cleaning, visualization, and regression analysis.

### Decision Trees
Projects implementing decision tree algorithms for classification and regression tasks.

### EXCEL
Projects demonstrating data analysis and visualization using Microsoft Excel.

### LINEAR REGRESSION
